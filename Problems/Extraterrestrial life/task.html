  <p>In a galaxy far, far away, there is a planet where biology works in mysterious ways. Not only do the planet's residents inherit genes from their parents, but also parts of their identity. Each parent contributes one half.</p> 
  <p>Read two strings with parental genetic information, find their IDs and calculate the mean, that is <span class="math-tex">\(alien = \frac{id(one) + id(other)}{2}\)</span> .</p> 
  <p>Note that the found identity should be an integer. Also, do <em>NOT</em> rename the variables defined below.</p>
