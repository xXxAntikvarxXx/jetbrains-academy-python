  <p>Imagine, there are three children in a family and they wrote down what they want to be when they grow up:</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-python">children = {'Emily': 'artist', 'Adam': 'astronaut', 'Nancy': 'programmer'}</code></pre> 
  <p>Let's say you want to store not only the profession they have chosen, but also their age: Emily is 5, Adam is 9, and Nancy is 14. To do so, you can create nested dictionaries for each key in the outer dictionary.</p> 
  <p>For each name, create a nested dictionary with the keys <code class="language-python">'profession'</code> and <code class="language-python">'age'</code>, modify the dictionary <code class="language-python">children</code> but don't print it.</p> 
  <p><strong>NB:</strong> write the age as an integer.</p>
