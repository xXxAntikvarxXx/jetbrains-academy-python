  <p>In math, we call a natural number prime if it's greater than <strong>1</strong> and can be evenly divided only by <strong>1</strong> and itself (without any remainder):</p> 
  <p><samp>2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, ...</samp></p> 
  <p>Create a list of all primes up to <strong>1000</strong> in the code below. Just save this list into a variable <code class="java">prime_numbers</code>, you don't have to print anything.</p> 
  <p>Make use of <code class="java">any()</code> or <code class="java">all()</code> to check if a number <strong>n</strong> leaves a zero remainder when divided by values from <strong>2</strong> to <strong>n - 1</strong> (inclusively).</p>
