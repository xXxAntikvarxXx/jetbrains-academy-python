  <p>Ruth goes shopping today, so she is busy making a shopping list.</p> 
  <p>She wrote down things that she would like to buy at the grocery store: first <code class="java">"milk"</code>, then <code class="java">"olive oil"</code> and <code class="java">"bananas"</code>. When sneaking a look at the fridge, she noticed that there was some <strong><em>milk </em></strong>left and changed her mind about buying a new one. It got crossed out of the list. And, like a cherry on top, a <code class="java">"brownie"</code> became the last item Ruth had put on the list.</p> 
  <p>Now you try to replicate these operations on the variable <code class="java">shopping_list</code>.</p> 
  <p>You are <em>NOT </em>supposed to print the results.</p> 
  <p><button class="btn-sm btn-outline-secondary" onclick="getElementById('hint-725').style.display='inline'"> Hint </button> </p>
  <div id="hint-725" style="display:none;">
   You can add an item with 
   <code class="java">list.append()</code> and delete it with 
   <code class="java">list.remove()</code>.
  </div>
