  <p>Lucy is drawing a poster with English contractions for her students. We will join her English club and help with learning materials.</p> 
  <p>Print the following strings with contractions:</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-no-highlight">I am = I'm
I have = I've
I will = I'll
I had / would = I'd</code></pre> 
  <p>Each string should be on a new line. This will be easy if you use quotes wisely.</p>
