  <p>Let's say you have a dict with children's names and professions they would like to have when they grow up:</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-python">children = {'Emily': 'artist', 'Adam': 'astronaut', 'Nancy': 'programmer'}</code></pre> 
  <p>But what if someone's choice has changed? Say, Emily now wants to be a musician. Update the dict and print the new version.</p>
