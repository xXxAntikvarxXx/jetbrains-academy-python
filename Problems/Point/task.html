  <p>Create a class <code class="language-python">Point</code> that will represent a point in space. Its constructor needs two parameters <span class="math-tex">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math-tex">\(y\)</span>, the coordinates of a point on the plane. The class should have a method <code class="language-python">dist</code> that takes another instance of <code class="language-python">Point</code> and returns the Euclidean distance between these two points. For <code class="language-python">Point(x1, y1)</code> and <code class="language-python">Point(x2, y2)</code>, calculate the distance according to the formula:</p> 
  <p><span class="math-tex">\[d = \sqrt{(x_1 - x_2)^2 + (y_1 - y_2)^2}\]</span>Have a look at the following example:</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-python">p1 = Point(1.5, 1)
p2 = Point(1.5, 2)

print(p1.dist(p2))  # 1.0</code></pre> 
  <p>Just create the class, you won't need anything else.</p>
