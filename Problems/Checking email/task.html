  <p>Let's say you've created a registration form for people wanting to take part in your online book club. In order to send them invitations, you need to know their email address, so you are writing a program to check whether the field "email" is filled correctly.</p> 
  <p>Write a function that takes a string and checks that:</p> 
  <ol> 
   <li>it doesn't contain spaces,</li> 
   <li>it contains the <strong>@</strong> symbol,</li> 
   <li>after <strong>@</strong>,<strong> </strong>there's a dot.</li> 
  </ol> 
  <p>Note that dots may also occur before <strong>@</strong>, and in a correct address a dot shouldn't stand immediately after <strong>@</strong>.</p> 
  <p>The function should return <code class="java">True</code> if all of the conditions are true, and <code class="java">False</code> otherwise.</p> 
  <p>You are not supposed to handle input or call your function, just implement it.</p>
