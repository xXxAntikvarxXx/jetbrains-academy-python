  <p>Let's say you need to keep track of the arguments passed to the script <code class="java">test.py</code>. You know that it takes four arguments: write a module that gets them from the command line and prints them as a list. All arguments will be numerical.</p> 
  <p>The interaction with the command line takes place in the computer itself so we can't check this task directly. So let's make it this way: the input will be the list <code class="java">args</code> containing what you would otherwise get from <code class="java">sys.argv</code>, and you should just write what you would do next.</p> 
  <p>E.g. <code class="java">args = ["script.py", "1", "2", "3", "4"]</code>, then your output should be <code class="java">[1, 2, 3, 4]</code> with the list elements as numbers.</p>
