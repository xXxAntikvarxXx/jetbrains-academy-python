  <p>In online test games, there is usually a limited number of lives: if, for example, you make 3 mistakes, you lose and do not continue with the game. Imagine you are trying to implement that system to an existing online test that doesn't have it yet.</p> 
  <p><strong>The input format:</strong></p> 
  <p>A line with <strong>N</strong> scores of a user in a test game separated by a space: <strong>C </strong>for the correct answer and <strong> I </strong>for the incorrect answer. <strong>N </strong>will be between 15 and 50.</p> 
  <p><strong>The output format:</strong></p> 
  <p>If the user loses the game, print "<strong>Game over" </strong>and their score (how many correct answers they gave). If the user wins, print <strong>"You won" </strong> and their score. The message should be printed without quotation marks. The message and the score should be printed on separate lines.</p>
