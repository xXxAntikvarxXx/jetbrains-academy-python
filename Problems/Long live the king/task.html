  <p>Let's imagine a chessboard, the squares on which are marked with coordinates. The coordinates are numbers between 1 and 8 inclusively. The first number indicates a column, the second one indicates a row.</p> 
  <p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" height="242" src="https://ucarecdn.com/cbd97f5f-f89c-47d8-82e9-82de3b752632/" width="236"></p> 
  <p>The chess king can stand on any square and can move one step horizontally, vertically, or diagonally in any direction within the board.</p> 
  <p>The input will contain the coordinates on which the king is located. You should figure out and print how many moves the figure can make: for example, from the position (1, 8), the king can make only 3 moves (right, down, diagonally).</p>
