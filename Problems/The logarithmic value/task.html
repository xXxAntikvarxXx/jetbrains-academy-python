   Whoa! This problem is much more complex than the usual one and requires knowledge of 
   <strong>if-else</strong> statements. If you're feeling up to the challenge, brace yourself and good luck! Otherwise, you can skip it by now and return any time later

  <p>Write a program that reads two integers (the first is always positive) and calculates the logarithmic value of the first integer with the second integer as a base. If the second integer is negative, 0 or 1, return the natural log of the first number.</p> 
  <p>Use the function <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html#math.log" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">log()</a> from the <samp>math</samp> module. With one argument, it returns the natural logarithm of a number. It can also take two arguments: a number and a logarithmic base.</p> 
  <p>Print the result <strong>rounded to 2 decimal places</strong>.</p>
