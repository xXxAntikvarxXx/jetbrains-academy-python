  <p>Anthony goes for a walk every morning, and a special app counts how many meters he walks. Calculate how much Anthony walks on average per day.</p> 
  <p>The input list with Anthony's walks looks something like this:</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-python">walks = [
    {"day": "Monday", "distance": 2000},
    {"day": "Tuesday", "distance": 3000},
    {"day": "Wednesday", "distance": 3500},
    {"day": "Thursday", "distance": 2500},
    {"day": "Friday", "distance": 2500},
    {"day": "Saturday", "distance": 1000},
    {"day": "Sunday", "distance": 5600}]</code></pre> 
  <p>Your task is to write a program that would access the values, count the mean, and print the result of integer division: in this case. for example, the output would be <code class="language-python">2871</code>.</p>
