  <p>Anne is writing a program that deals with the books in a bookstore. She created a class <code class="java">Book</code> and defined all necessary attributes: <code class="java">author</code>, <code class="java">title</code>, <code class="java">price</code> and <code class="java">book_id</code>. She would like to print out information about books in a concise and uniform way, but she doesn't know how to do that.</p> 
  <p>Help Anne by defining the right method so that she can easily print out information about her books in the following format:<strong> </strong><strong>{title} by {author}. ${price}. [{book_id}]</strong></p> 
  <p><button class="btn-sm btn-outline-secondary" onclick="getElementById('hint-570').style.display='inline'"> Hint </button> </p>
  <div id="hint-570" style="display:none;">
   There are two methods that you can define, both work for this problem.
  </div>
