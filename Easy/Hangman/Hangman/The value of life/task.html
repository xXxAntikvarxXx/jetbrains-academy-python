<h2>Description</h2>

<p>The recent version of the game is not as fun until we don't handle the player's victory. A player has 8 attempts to guess letters and its number is reduced even if the letter was correct.</p>

<p>Now a player will have a lot of attempts and is limited only by the number of mistakes they make. A player can be mistaken 8 times and wins when <strong>all</strong> the letters are guessed and there are still some tries left. If the player uses the last try and actually guesses the word, they are lucky then!</p>

<h2>Objectives</h2>

<p>The player starts the game with 8 "lives", that is our player can input the wrong letter 8 times.</p>

<ol>
	<li>Print <code class="java">No such letter in the word</code> and reduce the attempts count if the word guessed by the program doesn't contain this letter.</li>
	<li>Print <code class="java">No improvements</code> and reduce the attempts count if the guessed word contains this letter but the user tried this letter before.</li>
	<li>The attempts count should be decreased <strong>only</strong> if there are no letters to uncover.</li>
</ol>

<p><div class="alert alert-warning">Please, make sure that your program's output formatting precisely follows the example output formatting. Pay attention to the empty lines between tries and in the end.</div></p>

<h2>Examples</h2>

<p>The greater-than symbol followed by space (<code class="java">&gt; </code>) represents the user input. Notice that it's not the part of the input.</p>
