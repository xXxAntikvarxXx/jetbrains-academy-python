<p><strong>Hangman</strong> is a popular yet grim intellectual game. A cruel computer hides a word from you. Letter by letter you try to guess it. If you fail, you'll be hanged, if you win, you'll survive. See also: <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangman_(game)" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Wikipedia</a></p>

<p>You probably played the game at least once in your life; now you can actually create this game yourself!</p>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>Let's have a brief overview of what you are going to build during this project. Here is what the gameplay should look like:</p>

<ol>
	<li>In the main menu, a player can choose to either play or exit the game;</li>
	<li>If the user chooses to play, the computer picks a word from a list: this will be the riddle;</li>
	<li>The computer asks the player to enter a letter that (s)he thinks is in the word;</li>
	<li>If there's no such letter in the word and this letter hasn't been tried before, the computer counts it as a miss. A player can afford only up to 8 misses before the game is over;</li>
	<li>If the letter does occur in the word, the computer notifies the player. If there are letters left to guess, the computer invites the player to go on.</li>
	<li>When the entire word is uncovered, it's a victory! The game calculates the final score and goes back to the main menu.</li>
</ol>

<p>It may sound complex, but the project is split into small stages with hints to see you through. The final product is sure to be replayable and quite engaging!</p>

<p>Let's start with an announcement that will greet the player. You already know how to print something using Python: try to apply your knowledge to intrigue your friends with your game announcement!</p>

<h2>Objectives</h2>

<p>In this stage you should <strong>write a program </strong>that prints the lines as shown in the example below:</p>

<p>Output:</p>
