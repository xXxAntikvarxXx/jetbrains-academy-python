<h2>Description</h2>

<p>At this stage, you will create a real game. It will be simple, but there will be two possible outcomes (you can see in the examples below how they look like). Let's first print a welcome message and then ask a player to guess the word we set for the game. If our player manages to guess the exact word, the game reports "win"; otherwise it will "hang" the player.</p>

<h2>Objectives</h2>

<ol>
	<li>Ask a player for a possible word.</li>
	<li>Print <code class="java">You survived!</code> if the user guessed the word.</li>
	<li>Print <code class="java">You are hanged!</code> if the user haven't guessed the word</li>
</ol>

<p><div class="alert alert-primary">By the way, the word <code class="java">python</code> should be the correct word to win the game.</div></p>

<h2>Examples</h2>

<p>The greater-than symbol followed by space (<code class="java">&gt; </code>) represents the user input. Notice that it's not the part of the input.</p>

<p><strong>Example 1</strong></p>

<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">H A N G M A N
Guess the word: &gt; python
You survived!</code></pre>

<p><strong>Example 2</strong></p>

<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">H A N G M A N
Guess the word: &gt; java
You are hanged!</code></pre>
