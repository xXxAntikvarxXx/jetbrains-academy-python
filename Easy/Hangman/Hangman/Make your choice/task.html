<h2>Description</h2>

<p>If there is a predefined word, the game isn't replayable: you already know the word, so it makes no sense to guess it. At this stage, let's make the game more challenging by choosing a word from a special list with a variety of options. This way, our game won't be just a one-time entertainment.</p>

<h2>Objectives</h2>

<ol>
	<li>Create the following word list: <code class="java">'python', 'java', 'kotlin', 'javascript'</code>.</li>
	<li>Program the game to choose a random word from it. You can enter more words, but let's stick to these four for now.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Examples</h2>

<p>The greater-than symbol followed by space (<code class="java">&gt; </code>) represents the user input. Notice that it's not the part of the input.</p>

<p><strong>Example 1, </strong><em> the computer randomly chose <code class="java">python</code> from the list.</em></p>

<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">H A N G M A N
Guess the word: &gt; python
You survived!</code></pre>

<p><strong>Example 2, </strong><em>the computer randomly chose something other than <code class="java">python</code> from the list.</em></p>

<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">H A N G M A N
Guess the word: &gt; python
You are hanged!</code></pre>

<p><strong>Example 3, </strong><em>the computer randomly chose something other than <code class="java">kotlin</code> from the list.</em></p>

<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">H A N G M A N
Guess the word: &gt; kotlin
You are hanged!</code></pre>
