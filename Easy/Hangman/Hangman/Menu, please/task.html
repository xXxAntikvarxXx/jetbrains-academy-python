<h2>Description</h2>

<p>We're almost done!</p>

<p>Let's add more flavor to the game by adding a suggestion to replay after the current game session ends.</p>

<h2>Objectives</h2>

<ol>
	<li>The game starts with a menu where a player can choose to either play or exit.</li>
	<li>Print <code class="java">Type "play" to play the game, "exit" to quit:</code> and ask again if the player inputs something else.</li>
	<li>If the user chooses to play, the game starts.</li>
</ol>

<p><div class="alert alert-warning">Please, make sure that your program's output formatting precisely follows the example output formatting. Pay attention to the empty lines between tries and in the end.</div></p>

<h2>Example</h2>

<p>The greater-than symbol followed by space (<code class="java">&gt; </code>) represents the user input. Notice that it's not the part of the input.</p>
